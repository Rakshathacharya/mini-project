##comparitive analysis of synchronous and asynchronous fifo
###abstract
Because of flexibility of application and highest performance, thrills and middle end For a obtained extensive market. As a fundamental memory structure. The FIFO is widely used in FPGA based projects. But limited by the resources in chip and imperfections of development tools, the problem of insufficient memory while the overall capacity is often enough occurs in implementation of multi-channel FIFO. This project surveys various occasion applications of FIFO and puts forward the implementation of FIFO Memory Using Shift registers.
